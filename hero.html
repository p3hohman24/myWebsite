<h3> I enjoy playing baseball and Buster Posey if my Baseball Hero, he plays on the San Fransico Giants as there starting catcher. He is an all around great player, with an impressive batting average of .302. His career batting average is the 8th best among active Major League Players. He is a right handed batter and uses his right arm for throwing as well. He has over 140 career home runs, 1,380 hits, 595 Runs Scored, and 673 runs batted in. He started playing for the Giants in 2009. Ten years later he's still playing  for the San Fransico giants.

     There are a couple different reasons I have chosen Buster Posey. I have played baseball for pretty much as long as I can remember. It's my favorite sport to play. On the various baseball teams I have played on, I have always played catcher. Buster Posy is an amazing catcher and he plays on my favorite team. I grew up watching him and he was always my sports hero. Also in addition to his amazing sports abilities he has participated in many fundrasiers and other things of that nature, him and his wife Kristen have commited to rase much needed funds for the "V foundations" pediatric cacner research efforts.
